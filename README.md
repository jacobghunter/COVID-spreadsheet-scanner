# COVID-spreadsheet-scanner

I made this project in my senior year of high school in my International Baccalaureate (IB) Computer Science class as our Internal Assesment and I recieved a 6 out of 7 on it.
In the project I found and worked for a real client to develop a program to search and sort through entries on a COVID-19 screener form. 
Athletes were required to fill out the form every practice so other athletes who had contact with them could be notified of their exposure.

The entire process including planning, transcribed meetings with the client, and documentation on how the program works can be found in the documentation folder.

To view the project as it was submitted to IB, clone the repo and open "cover_page.htm"
